NSS Part Time Data Analytics Cohort 2

### Development

* Clone down the repo
* You need a local server running to power some of the javascript going on.
We like python3. 
Run this in your terminal, within the directory of this project:
```bash
python3.7 -m http.server
``` 
* Then, make changes as needed. 
You should be able to go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser!
As you make changes in the code, refresh your browser to see them committed.
